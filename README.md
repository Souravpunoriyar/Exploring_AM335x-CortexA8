# Exploring_AM335x-CortexA8-
Exploring AM335x-A8 and Beaglebone black bootloader from scratch <br />

Special Thanks :-)<br />
1> sysplay.in: Anil Kumar Pugalia for inspiring and giving me his initial code to explore more.<br />
2> Friends<br />
3> Opensource Community and various forums like stackoverflow, TI , BBB and others.<br />

What i want to achieve :-<br />
I am writing this code in-order to explore ARM.<br />
The Major things i want to cover:<br />

1> Simple and detailed description for all code whatever i do or take into.<br />
2> Keep code as simple as i can.<br />
3> Explore various aspects of ARM.<br />
4> Writing single and secure multi-stage bootloader<br />
5> Booting HelenOS.<br />
6> Keep learning things from AM335x platform.<br />

<<<<<<< HEAD
Contents:-
1> Get and understand initial code with serial.(from sysplay.in)---> done
2> Realize modes in arm.---->done
3> Become familier with arm instruction set.-->done
4> Explore core-register to collect more information.--->done and adding more
5> Create a framework for adding and deleting feature while compilation.
6> Initialize core components.
7> Jump from  SRAM to DDR.
8> Add some secure boot feature.
9> Run HeleOS or write a OS from scratch.
10> Bootloader contents follows steps from Boot_seq_to_follow (readme).<br />

1X >....Will add more to list
